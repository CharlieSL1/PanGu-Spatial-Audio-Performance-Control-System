## Background

As a music creator working with multichannel and spatial audio, I am interested in moving beyond the flat left–right logic of stereo toward a genuinely three-dimensional approach to performance. Instead of treating sound as a horizontal line in front of the audience, I aim to design a system in which performers think and act inside a volumetric sound field, where their position and gestures can directly shape trajectories, focus, and relationships between sound objects in space. This framework is not limited to electronic music: it can extend to theatre and musical theatre, where actors and singers become spatial sound sources, and their movement across the stage dynamically drives real-time spatialization and sound design, turning space itself into an active compositional parameter.
